### Automatic Helmet Detection

Provide Lisence plate numbers of motocycle riders without helmets. A custom trained Object Detection model based on YOLO-v3 architecture was used to detect riders without helmets from live feed of surveillence cameras or images.

This is just a collection of topics and algorithms that in my opinion are interesting.

It contains several topics that are not so popular nowadays, but that can be very powerful. Usually, topics such as PDE methods, LÃ©vy processes, Fourier methods or Kalman filter are not very popular among practitioners, who prefers to work with more standard tools.
The aim of these notebooks is to present these interesting topics, by showing their practical application through an interactive python implementation.
